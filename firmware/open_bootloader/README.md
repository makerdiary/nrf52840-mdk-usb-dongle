## DFU via Open Bootloader

The nRF52840 MDK USB Dongle was previously shipped with [Open Bootloader](https://github.com/makerdiary/nrf52840-mdk-usb-dongle/tree/master/firmware/open_bootloader) with Device Firmware Update (DFU) functionality. You can easily program the Dongle using the following tools:

* [nRF Connect for Desktop](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Tools/nRF-Connect-for-desktop)
* [nrfutil](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfutil/) from the command line.

See the [Wiki](https://wiki.makerdiary.com/nrf52840-mdk-usb-dongle/programming/#dfu-via-open-bootloader) page for information on how to use Open Bootloader.

## Upgrade to UF2 Bootloader from Open Bootloader

UF2 Bootloader is available for the nRF52840 MDK USB Dongle. You can upgrade to UF2 Bootloader to take advantage of the latest features.

**Note:** As Open Bootloader update must come from signed packages, the new UF2 Bootloader must be signed. The signed package is `uf2_bootloader-0.2.13-44-gb2b4284-nosd_signed.zip`.

Enter DFU mode by holding the dongle's RESET/USR button and connecting to your PC. Use the following command to update firmware:

``` sh
nrfutil dfu usb-serial -pkg uf2_bootloader-0.2.13-44-gb2b4284-nosd_signed.zip -p <your-serial-port-name>
```

## Change to Open Bootloader from UF2 Bootloader

You can also change to Open Bootloader from UF2 Bootloader by performing the following steps:

1. Run the following command to install `adafruit-nrfutil` from Adafruit's GitHub repository (Version had to be locked due to updates done to the util since this was written):

	```
	pip3 install https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_nrfutil/archive/474a584a97590f0fe928f1633596f809b4ab1297.zip
	```

2. Download the Open Bootloader package generated by `adafruit-nrfutil`. The generated package is: [nrf52840_mdk_usb_dongle_open_bootloader_v1.2.0.uf2.zip](https://github.com/makerdiary/nrf52840-mdk-usb-dongle/raw/master/firmware/open_bootloader/nrf52840_mdk_usb_dongle_open_bootloader_v1.2.0.uf2.zip).

3. Enter DFU mode by holding the dongle's RESET/USR button and connecting to your PC. Use the following command to flash Open Bootloader:

	```
	adafruit-nrfutil --verbose dfu serial --package nrf52840_mdk_usb_dongle_open_bootloader_v1.2.0.uf2.zip -p <serial-port-name> -b 115200 --singlebank
	```

	Note that replace `<serial-port-name>` with your own dongle's serial port name, e.g. `COMx`.
