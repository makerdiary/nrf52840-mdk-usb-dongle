You can start the capture manually from Wireshark, a free software tool that captures wireless traffic and reproduces it in a readable format, or using a Python script. Use either of these methods to create packet capture files, from which you can extract data in Wireshark. This data can include destination and source addresses, personal area network identifiers, and packet payloads.</p> <p>The nRF Sniffer for 802.15.4 comes with an extcap plugin for capturing packets in Wireshark.
