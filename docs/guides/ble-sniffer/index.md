# nRF Sniffer for Bluetooth LE

## Introduction

nRF Sniffer for Bluetooth LE is a useful tool for debugging and learning about Bluetooth Low Energy applications.

The nRF Sniffer for Bluetooth LE allows near real-time display of Bluetooth LE packets. This helps the developer to identify and fix issues by allowing a view of what is happening on-air.
